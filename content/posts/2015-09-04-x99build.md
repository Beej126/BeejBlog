**Mobo**: [Gigabyte GA-X99-UD4][7] &#8211; LGA 2011-v3

**CPU**: Intel i7-5820k &#8211; 6 core Haswell-E

**Cooler**: Corsair H80i GT

**PSU**: [Corsair HX750i][8]

**RAM**:&nbsp;Crucial 32GB (4 x 8GB) Ballistix Sport (DDR4 PC4-19200&nbsp;2400 MHz, 16-16-16 CAS)

**Case**:&nbsp;[Cooler Master Storm Scout 2 Advanced][9] &#8211; love that&nbsp;rubber&nbsp;top handle! ðŸ™‚

**SSD**:&nbsp;SAMSUNG 850 EVO 500GB

**Video**: [Asus Strix Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti 2GB][10] &#8230; this card is a perfect fit in my book:

  * No drivers necessary to [vanilla boot into Yosemite][11] &#8211; no QE/CI out of box but very workable for initial install and then full QE/CI via Nvidia &#8220;webdriver&#8221;.
  * fanless unless pushed hard
  * 3 x digital display, INCLUDING DP &#8211; I can confirm this card supports at least dual monitors under Yosemite via any combination of DP / HDMI / DVI (dual- link) with any of them driving 2560 x 1600 res&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen mention of possible 4k support on this card and can&#8217;t wait to confirm that myself ðŸ™‚
  * no more horsepower than I care to pay for => $160 at the time &#8230; and was well stocked in major outlets circa March 2015

Biggest gripe &#8211; <span class="hl">the Corsair USB software is total junk</span>&#8230; It sounds cool to be able to monitor temps but it is so bad I would seriously recommend against it&#8230; I traced OS X re-wake back to the H80i cooler and the drivers are all super flaky under windows&#8230; reports of all kinds of known issues installing on Win8 and above out there on the interwebs&#8230; even with the well known hacks in place, only some rare reboots would yield working gauges for me&#8230; looks like USB device initialization timing bugs&#8230; sounds neat at face value but the unreliable drivers ruin the whole experience&#8230; there are open source alternatives brewing&#8230; guess there&#8217;s a new build up for Win10, we&#8217;ll see how that goes.

2015-09-03 Update: Spooky! Machine was just totally dead this morning, no power up at all &#8230; jiggled the usual stuff, manually shunted the mobo power-on pins, re-seated ram, nothing&#8230; was expecting dead PSU but it checked out fine on voltmeter&#8230; and test button on PSU revved up the fans just fine&#8230; so next i started figuring dead mobo and was basically giving up &#8230; then the big guy nudged a thought into my sad mind, &#8220;try the paperclip trick&#8221;&#8230; so i shunted pins 15 & 16 on the back of the 24pin header (while PSU connected to mobo) and sure enough it all powered right up <whew>&#8230; after that the case power button was working normally again as well&#8230; no other changes&#8230;

very interesting behavior &#8230; really grasping to place blame anywhere particular &nbsp;???

i shudder to think of the time and effort i could have easily wasted swapping out working components chasing this ghost

we did have a power outage here a couple days ago but the machine had been running fine since then; even going in and out of sleep mode so it&#8217;s hard to think there would be something &#8220;lingering&#8221;&#8230; yet there i was
