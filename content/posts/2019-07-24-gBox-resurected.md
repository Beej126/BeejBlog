## The Geek Love Story

Way back in probably about 2002 I believe I saw this case in the back ads of an InfoWorld magazine. I remember browsing the magazine in the company lunch room and as soon as I saw the shiny acrylic and aluminum I knew it must be mine =)

It's really the "LAN box" handle that makes it unique even to this day... I am also strongly drawn to the minimalist efficiency of Small Form Factor (SFF) but those are fairly plentiful on their own... Yet the market apparently has little interest in the utility of a handle... I find it quite natural... for people that fiddle with their hardware, it's very common to need to hoist it to some workbench or just flip it around to plug in a new cable.

- [Falcon Northwest original "Fragbox"]()
- It's cool that here in 2019 Falcon continues to provide a rare SFF with handle... they were using a SilverStone case for a few years after the original Chyang... not sure what it is these days.
- Comparing bang/buck of a current Northwest fagbox I feel pretty good... versus their $2335, I upped my build to an 8 Core 9900k, 32GB ram, bigger Corsair SF600 PSU and the preferrable ASRock mITX board which includes TB3 all for about $1200, even subtracting $400 to account for their video card that is still quite a nice margin.  Admiteddly, their paintjob is probably the remaining cost and my end result isn't that polished, but enthusiasts know there's a ton of joy that comes from repeatedly gazing at a functional work of their own.  I am not planning to run a discrete GPU, I'm not a real gamer...it does also make for a very smooth hackintosh for iOS mobile development due to a solid TonyMac guide... and in the past multiple cores was nice for running both [Windows and macOS under ESXI](/2016/06/esxi-for-winmac-xamarin-ios-dev-nirvana.html).
