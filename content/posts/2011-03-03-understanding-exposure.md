      <p>
        Make sure you get the latest edition (currently Aug.2010).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Bryan has a an easy going writing style packed with tons of real examples.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It‚Äôs not a very long book (~175 pages) and there are lots of great example photos filling up nearly every page.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It is highly rated on Amazon‚Ä¶ only $20 with shipping.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Basic takeaways for my own future reference:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bryan uses the term ‚ÄúExposure Triangle‚Äù to relate the three interrelated fundamentals of capturing ideal exposure: F-stop (aperture size), Shutter Speed and ISO.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photography of course has a lot to do with *<b>light</b>* ‚Ä¶ how much light we have to work with and how much we want to let into the camera.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
          <u><strong>ISO</strong></u> <ul>
            <li>
              Undoubtedly the toughest one to grasp at the pure physics level. I appreciate how Bryan uses the simple metaphor of "worker bees" here.
            </li>
            <li>
              The higher the ISO, the more worker bees you have on your electronic photo sensor gathering the light particles. There is of course a trade-off and I think we've all observed the grainy result of too much ISO.
            </li>
            <li>
              It‚Äôs great to read the specific values & tips Bryan recommends throughout the book‚Ä¶ e.g. setting your ISO higher than 200 starts to lose contrast and color saturation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
          <strong><u>f/stop</u></strong> (aperture size) <ul>
            <li>
              aperture is literally the size of the opening allowing light to enter the camera‚Ä¶ Yet just controlling the amount of light is not really the most useful aspect of f-stop‚Ä¶
            </li>
            <li>
              More importantly f-stop is what determines the ‚Äúdepth of field‚Äù in a photograph.
            </li>
            <li>
              F/4.5 is a very ‚Äúaverage‚Äù middle point to begin with.
            </li>
            <li>
              The *<b>higher</b>* the F/# the *<b>smaller</b>* the aperture (light opening) (because the number is on the bottom of a division)
            </li>
            <li>
              Smaller apertures wind up pulling in a greater ‚Äúdepth of field‚Äù which just means <b>more of the background is sharper</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wider apertures (*smaller* f/#‚Äôs, i.e *divided* by a smaller number = bigger) give that fuzzy background effect (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh" target="_blank">bokeh</a>)‚Ä¶ typically when you want to draw the most attention to a specific subject vs a complex background.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
          <strong><u>Shutter Speed</u></strong> <ul>
            <li>
              this is the most intuitively obvious one in my mind‚Ä¶ it primarily determines whether you capture motion or not‚Ä¶ a quick shutter ‚Äústops action‚Äù‚Ä¶ a slow shutter gives that more blurry look to moving objects like water.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        We then balance all three of those in our ‚ÄúExposure Triangle‚Äù‚Ä¶
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For one example, starting with the desire to have full focus on a long view (e.g. big field of flowers), we select a high f/stop. If it's a bright easy light day, we can leave our ISO low ‚Ä¶ lastly we move the shutter speed up or down <u>until our camera‚Äôs light meter falls on ZERO</u>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b><u>I had never been clued in on that fundamental part about adjusting one or the other (aperture or shutter) in order to *move*the*light*meter* bar back to center zero.</u></b>&nbsp; One typically does this looking through the viewfinder at the little gauge of vertical bars with 0 in the middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a pretty big revelation for me. &nbsp;Maybe I'm particularly clueless üôÇ&nbsp;and it's considered so obvious that it's not worth mentioning; but I also wonder how many people carry around multiple hundred dollar cameras without knowing this.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For an alternative example, if we want to capture that ‚Äúblurry water‚Äù effect on a stream or a waterfall, we‚Äôll start with a longer shutter to (e.g. 1/8 sec or even 1 full sec) and then move the f/stop to get the light meter to 0‚Ä¶ the f/stop will be high in this case (perhaps even f/32) because a long shutter is a long exposure to light and therefore a correspondingly small opening is necessary to counteract that light washout (i.e. overexposure).</td>
