I’ve finally achieved my own _OS X like_ desktop nirvana on Windows 7:

  * StarDock’s <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/" target="_blank">ObjectDock</a> for the main OS X cool factor dock at the bottom 
  * After long searching for a way to reliably replicate all the Windows Notification Area functionality, I finally realized that running the standard Windows Taskbar minimized at the top of the screen is an excellent solution to the personal aesthetic I’ve been seeking. <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      <li>
        StarDock’s <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/objectbar/" target="_blank">ObjectBar</a> was pretty good but not perfect… there are several great skins that makes it look just like the Mac, and it replicates the Notification Area quite well.&#160; Unfortunately, for example, the volume icon did not work properly.&#160; It would not pop up the volume slider window (which is apparently technically called a “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511446.aspx#thumbnail" target="_blank">Thumbnail Toolbar</a>” in the Windows User Experience Guidelines).
      </li>
      <li>
        I love that the built in volume slider popup responds to the mouse wheel… that’s perfectly convenient for a quick change.
      </li>
    </ul>

  * An old tool called <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/kazubon/tclocklight/" target="_blank">TClock</a> allowed me to configure the clock exactly how I wanted it to **<u>include the date</u>**.&#160; Without this little tweak, when the Taskbar is this minimized, the native clock only displays the time.&#160; This little gem let’s you configure everything about the clock and even several other interesting Taskbar properties… like transparency, etc.&#160; Highly recommended. 
  * <a href="http://arshi2009.deviantart.com/art/Stack-Docklet-For-ObjectDock-103031280" target="_blank">StacksDocklet</a> by Arshi2009 is awesome for replicating the sexy OSX _stack_ effect… I’m using this to house my favorite little utilities & control panels. 
  * As you can see I’m running a couple other cool Docklets for the Weather and Clock (both come with ObjectDock), <a href="http://www.dockex.com/items/28" target="_blank">CPU Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=2349&libid=29" target="_blank">System Sleep</a> (which is actually scrolled off the far right of the screenshot).
