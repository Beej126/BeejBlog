### Background

Infrequently enough to forget, I find the need to redirect all non-SSL requests to SSL&#8230; or similarly, force the WWW prefix onto a url when the initial navigation comes in without it.
  
I instinctively reach for the URLRewrite module due to it&#8217;s flexibility, but i&#8217;ve found that it can actually lead me astray in these particular scenarios&#8230;

### TL;DR

Create a separate IIS web site for the &#8220;undesirable&#8221; url which does a simple HTTP Redirect to the desired path

### Elaboration

Especially in the case of SSL, this is definitely the way to go because you&#8217;ll also want to enable &#8220;Require SSL&#8221; &#8230; which outright prevents the the non-ssl url from being able to respond with a URLRewrite Rule&#8230; i.e. the Require SSL checkbox yields a hard 403 error immediately upon resolving the non-SSL path, no other logic executes&#8230; and at this point, the IIS admin console just stares back blankly awaiting orders with no help out of this blind alley.

### Security bonus

by creating a site entirely for the non-ssl redirect, we can then set that site&#8217;s physical path to something harmless, leaving no doubt the SSL URL is the only way in to our sensitive physical path.

### Separate Physical Folder FOR EACH SITE

To be perfectly clear, each redirecting sites&#8217; physical folder will now merely provide containment for its corresponding solitary web.config, yet it is crucial each site is indeed configured with a unique physical path and web.config&#8230; this is obvious once considered but can be a momentary point of confusion until one realizes why all the different sites&#8217; settings are overlapping ðŸ™‚
